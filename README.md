# frequency-response

Two LTspice projects which contain various BJT amplifier designs and their frequency response analyses. These projects were assigned for the Electronics II (EE 334) and Electronics Laboratory II (EE 336) courses in the Spring 2022 semester.



## Projects

[Homework 4: Low Frequency Response of BJT Amplifiers]()

[Experiment 7: Single-BJT Amplifiers at Low and High Frequencies](SingleBJTAmpsLowHighFrequencies)
